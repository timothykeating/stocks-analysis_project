### ANALYSIS
#### Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to assist our client in the creation of a Macro.  By using our skills in the language: Visual Basic for Applications, we were able to create this Macro for the client.  

This Macro will let our client focus on meaningful data, and our client will not have to spend anytime going through the raw data that he provided to us initially.

#### Results
We can compare the performance of the 12 selected stocks in 2017 versus the performance in 2018.  To state it briefly, 2017 was a good year and 2018 was a bad year, as far as returns were concerned.  An observer can quickly see the differences in these two images, between the green and the red cells: 
<image 2017>
<image 2018>
10 of the 12 stocks showed less returns in 2018 than 2017, including 4 stocks that were over 100 points lower in 2018 than 2017.  Only 2 stocks had better returns in 2018 than 2017, with stock "RUN" showing the highest increase in returns performance.
<image COMPARISON>
While it is true that "RUN" had positive returns both years, the green shading does not show us anything about the amplitude of those returns.  Consider "ENPH," which is the only other stock to have positive returns in both years.  A $100 investment in "ENPH" on Jan. 1, 2017 would be worth $417.56 on Dec. 31, 2018; a $100 investment in "RUN" over the same time period would only be worth $194.15.  Even "SEDG," which shows negative returns in 2018, had a better 2-year outcome - $100 invested in "SEDG" over the same time period would be worth $262.41
